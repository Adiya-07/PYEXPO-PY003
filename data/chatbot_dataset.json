        "⚠️ Doshas are planetary afflictions that can affect life. Major doshas: Manglik Dosha (Mars in 1st/4th/7th/8th/12th house — affects marriage), Nadi Dosha (same Nadi in compatibility — affects health/progeny), Kala Sarpa Dosha (all planets between Rahu-Ketu — affects overall life).",
        "🔱 Manglik Dosha remedy: Marry after 28 years, marry another Manglik, perform Kumbh Vivah, or chant Hanuman Chalisa daily. Nadi Dosha remedy: Nadi Nivarana Puja, donate gold, chant Mahamrityunjaya Mantra 108 times.",
        "💫 Kala Sarpa Dosha occurs when all 7 planets fall between Rahu and Ketu. Remedy: Perform Kala Sarpa Puja at Tryambakeshwar or Kalahasti. Chant Rahu mantra on Saturdays. Don't panic — it also gives spiritual power!"

        "⏳ Vimshottari Dasha is a 120-year planetary cycle. Each planet rules for a fixed period: Sun (6yr), Moon (10yr), Mars (7yr), Rahu (18yr), Jupiter (16yr), Saturn (19yr), Mercury (17yr), Ketu (7yr), Venus (20yr). Your current Dasha is calculated from your birth Nakshatra!",
